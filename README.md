# interfile

R package to read nuclear medicine imaging studies saved in the interfile file format.

## Getting Started

After installation, please the vignette for an example. Please see install the package using devtools::install_github() or install from CRAN.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome if you need to read interfiles. I have implemented a minimal subset of the interfile specification, which works for me but might not work for you. If you need help, just ask.
