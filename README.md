# interfile

R package to read nuclear medicine imaging studies saved in the interfile file format.

## Getting Started

After installation, please see the [vignette](https://github.com/kippjohnson/interfile/blob/master/vignettes/introduction.Rmd) for a short example. You can install the package using devtools::install_github("kippjohnson/interfile").

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome if you need to read interfiles into R.

Currently, I have implemented a minimal subset of the interfile specification, which works for me but might not work for you. If you need more, just ask me.
